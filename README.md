## ADDITIONAL NOTES
Jared, I am so sorry for this hot mess of a video game. I think my logic was so inefficent that it pushed the emulator to the brink that it can't keep up. There are so many odd glitches that I cannot even begin to explain or know how to recreate and I do not have enough time to nuke this homework and start over. It's so joever.
